Topics: [[#Data]] & [[#Takeaways]]

Suzan lau directly started with explaining how she filters the content. which is done in the back-end.
Her website uses PHP for back-end stuff. She says that in the end it doesnt really matter which back-end you use because they all do the same one way or another.
She uses the framework Symphony.

She uses .Twig as a templating engine to structure her HTML together with PHP.

## Data
Campspace has quite a lot of API's

instead of placing all the data in one database row they decided to split it into different sections. 
The campsite page has over **200 database queries**. Which is a lot.
If the site were to have more people searching campsites at the same time the server would struggle.

They use **elasticSearch** for multi-dimension data in a JSON format. This is for filtering content.
